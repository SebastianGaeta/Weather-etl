# Weather-etl
This project is a simple (ETL) pipeline built in Python that collects real-time weather forecast data for multiple U.S. cities from the [National Weather Service (NOAA) API](https://api.weather.gov/).   It extracts forecast data, cleans and transforms it, then loads it into a MySQL database for long-term storage and analysis.
